# AppleCIDR
This will parse a scope file containing IP ranges, CIDR notations, and domains and output them as a list of individual IP addresses and domains. This helps with compatibility for tools that require IPs in a straightforward format for ingestion rather than ranges.

## Usage
```
python3 AppleCIDR.py <filename>
```
